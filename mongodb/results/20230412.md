## Method

Random access file 100 times for given set of numbers of data structures.

## Result

Benchmark #1 to #4 attemps to evaluate the average access(query) time over expansion of record number.

|     | App | Model | Field | Record | Min (ms) | Max (ms) | Avg (ms) |
| --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| #1  | 1   | 10    | 10    | 100    | 0.001  | 0.007 | 0.00252|
| #2  | 1   | 10    | 10    | 1000   |0.001 | 0.006 | 0.00241 |

| #4  | 1   | 10    | 10    | 100000 | 0.001 | 0.006 | 0.00222|


Benchmark #5 to #6 attemps to evaluate the average access(query) time over expansion of App number.

|     | App | Model | Field | Record | Min (ms) | Max (ms) | Avg (ms) |
| --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| #1  | 1   | 10    | 10    | 100    | 0.001  | 0.007 | 0.00227|
